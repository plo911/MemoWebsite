Reporting a Vulnerability
 
We take security seriously and appreciate your help in keeping our project safe.  If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in our project, please disclose it responsibly by following these steps: 
 
 
Report privately:  Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability. Instead, send a detailed report to [erik8347@gmail.com].  This allows us to address the issue before it can be exploited. 
 
 
Provide comprehensive information: Your report should include: 
 
Version(s) affected: Specify the version(s) of the project where the vulnerability exists.
 
Detailed description: Clearly explain the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it.  Include screenshots or code examples if applicable.
 
Impact: Describe the potential impact of the vulnerability.
 
Suggested solution (optional): If you have a suggestion for a fix, please include it.

   
Acceptance/Rejection: If the reported issue is confirmed as a vulnerability, we will work to fix it promptly. We will keep you informed of the status of the fix and release a security advisory once the fix is deployed.  If the reported issue is not considered a vulnerability, we will explain our reasoning. 
 
 
Disclosure Coordination: We ask that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have released a fix and published a security advisory. This allows us to ensure that all users are protected.  We will work with you to coordinate a responsible disclosure timeline. 
 
 
We value your contribution to the security of our project and appreciate your responsible disclosure.  Thank you for your help.
