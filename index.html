    <h2 class="text2">
        Hello! I am a game developer and am an independent who is interested in creating immersive and engaging experiences. With a background in game sketch design <br>from Skellefte√•, I specialize in creating intuitive UI, coherent themes and smooth integration of gameplay. <br>I'm also looking into AI to improve the dynamics of the game.
        <br>I thrive in focused environments and deliver high quality results while being inspired by music.
